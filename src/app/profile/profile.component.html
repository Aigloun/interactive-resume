      <p>
        Overall I'm an experienced developer and I understand very well business
        needs to deliver high quality items.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy facing challenges and difficult tasks and I'm able to perform
        well under pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also fit great in a team because I adapt and learn very fast in a new
        environment, I always make time to provide support or guidance to my
        colleagues and I love to have feedback on my work and try to expand my
        knowledge.
