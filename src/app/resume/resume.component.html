<h1>Hey there!</h1>

<div>
  <p>
    My name is Jordan BORDONADO and I'm a fullstack developer for Air France in
    Sophia-Antipolis (France).
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a lot of passion for development and I like clean code, fairly tested
    and easy to read so I try to set high expectations for myself.

    Feel free to dig through the different sections of the site to get to know
    me.

    You can find my contact details either in the Profile section or in the
    footer, in case you want to get in touch!
